### Why is Empire Hacking a membership-based group?

**To cultivate a tight-knit community**. This should be a place where members feel free to discuss private or exclusive research and data, knowing that it will remain within the group. Furthermore, we believe that a membership process increases motivation to make a high-quality contribution.

**To protect against abuse**. Everyone is expected to treat his or her fellow members with respect and decency. Violators lose membership and all access to the group, including membership lists, meeting locations, and our discussion board.

### What is the Chatham House Rule?

Simply, you can repeat what you hear at the meetings but you can't attribute who you got the information from. Of course, you can always ask the person to go on the record, but by default, all conversations at our meetup are off the record and for background information only.

### Why does Empire Hacking use the Chatham House Rule?

We welcome everyone to apply to Empire Hacking, even journalists. But we donâ€™t want participants to worry that their personal thoughts will be relayed to outsiders, or used against them or their employers. We enforce the Chatham House Rule to preserve the balance between candor and discretion.
