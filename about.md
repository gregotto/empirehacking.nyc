## About Empire Hacking

Since we started the meetup in May 2015, we’ve been thrilled by the community that it has attracted. We’ve had some [excellent presentations](/archive/), shared our aspirations and annoyances with our work, and made some new friends.

Empire Hacking has been successful because it is:

* **Technical**. We bridge the gap between weekend projects and funded research. There are no product pitches here. Come prepared with your best ideas.
* **Exclusive**. Talks are by invitation-only and are under [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule). We will discuss ongoing research and internal projects you won’t hear about anywhere else.
* **Engaging**. Talk about subjects you find interesting, face to face, with a community of experts from across the industry.
