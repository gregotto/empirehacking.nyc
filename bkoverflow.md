## FAQ

### Where did the name come from?

Consider it a reboot: Brooklyn Overflow was founded in 2004 as a CTF team at NYU Tandon. Dormant for more than 15 years, we're bringing it back to reignite Empire Hacking with a new Brooklyn background.

### What is the precuations setup regarding COVID-19?

Out of respect for other attendees and patrons of the venue, please attend only if you have been vaccinated. We'll also have a backpack full of rapid tests available, for free, for any attendee to use on-site or take home with them. Finally, the venue has a large outdoor space with excellent ventilation.
